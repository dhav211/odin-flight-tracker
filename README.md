# Odin Flight Booker

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker

Damn, this one kinda broke me a little bit. Hit that Dunning-Kruger curve pretty hard on this one, felt pretty confident after the last project, which was the Private Events one, and was feeling like I understood many-to-many relationships pretty danged well, and I guess I was wrong. Eventually after some trial and error I wrapped my mind around it.

As always, nothing much to see here, just a log of me finishing TOP one project at a time.

Onwards!!
